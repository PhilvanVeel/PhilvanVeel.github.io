            <h2 class="featurette-heading fw-normal lh-1 text-black">Professional Identity</span></h2>
          <p class="lead" style="color: black;">My professional identity is rooted in my passion for the process of designing. I experiment with implementing new software, techniques and tricks to steer projects in new directions. I have a deep love for design sketching, which enables me to ideate, communicate and pitch. I am a creator, explorer and accommodator. My favourite design activities are problem exploration, ideation and discussion.</p>
		
		
          <p class="lead" style="color: black;">During my master's study, I gained knowledge about user experience and programming, but I also evolved my design process. Because I have always dreamt of designing and building a car, I joined the TU/ecomotive team as chief design. We created a sustainable electric vehicle within a year in this student team. I could express my passion for design sketching and CAD. Still, I also improved my ability to work in multi-disciplinary, multi-cultured teams, integrating hardware, rapid prototyping, and design leadership. Besides my learning activities, I Explored my passion for exploratory sketching broadly. As a designer, I worked on many side projects, including company logos and products. I assisted in design sketch courses, aided the succeeding TU/ecomotive team via workshops and feedback, and followed online courses to discover my preferred method and style.</p>
            <p class="lead" style="color: black;">Whereas my study trajectory guided me to become a designer in an automotive manufacturer, I learned that educating and designing with startups and smaller businesses are my favourite moments, which is why after graduation, I will apply for part-time educational jobs and create my design studio. I believe that the combination of gaining experience as a designer and the inspiration from education will enable me to make a valuable contribution to society and suits my skillset best. </p>

                <p class="lead">Manufacturers should explore modularity since it can offer product flexibility,
                    repairability, and customization. Product manufacturers should be regulated to reduce their
                    environmental footprint, E-waste generation, and waste generation. It is not within the power of the
                    consumer to change a systemic problem, and manufacturers should be forced into compliance with the
                    standardization of materials, connectors, and perhaps even material choice. As a designer, I believe
                    this will happen due to the environmental effects of mass overconsumption and ecological neglect.
                    Designers should prepare for this regulation by learning about sustainable materials, modularity,
                    and the circular economy.

                <p class="lead">As an aspiring design sketching teacher, I will strive to create a positive environment that emphasises the importance of patience, cultivating a growth mindset, and embracing failure as a part of growth. I will continue to motivate and support students to develop their design skills, encouraging them to experiment and take risks.

                    I believe education is never over, and as an aspiring teacher, I strive to challenge students to find their strengths. I will do my best to inspire a growth mindset. I want students to know that they can achieve their goals with patience, knowledge and efficient practice.

                    <p>Personal growth is always my number one priority in design. During projects, I always learn a new
                        skills. During 1.1, I did an innovation space project requiring a more business-like mindset and
                        skillset. In my 1.2, I did not only do my first design research project but also made it in
                        Unity. I will make sure to develop new skills during 2.1.
                        <br> <br>

                        I always wanted to pursue a career in the automotive industry, which led me to lead the
                        TU/Ecomotive Design team. Because of that experience, I was hired for intern positions at EBUSCO
                        and EDAG BV. These valuable experiences provided insight into working in the automotive
                        industry. I have done extracurricular activities such as Unity certificates, following
                        automotive sketching courses, and working as a teacher assistant for the exploratory sketching
                        course. I have many topics that I would like to learn more about. However, spare time is limited
                        during a master's track, so I always tried to implement my curiosity into my projects. 
                        
                        <br> <br>
                        During this master's program, I realized that corporate positions might not suit my interests. After
                        graduation, my goal is to find a job in sketching education and join a design studio. The one
                        consistency in my prior PDPs besides the automotive interest is that I switch interests often,
                        and having my design studio would mean I can work on a diverse and conceptual project. My
                        long-term goal is to establish my design studio.
                        <br> <br>

                        In my work environment, I value dedication and honesty. Sharing a passion and cultivating a
                        healthy, dedicated, and personal atmosphere is more important than anything in a creative field
                        since input equals output.

                    <p>Whereas most of my PIV documents were tailored towards automotive, I keep my final iteration more
                        general since my future goal is to diversify my projects. Although my automotive interest will
                        not likely ever stop, I would like to explore new topics for my starting position.
                        Sustainability
                        Manufacturers should explore modularity since it can offer product flexibility, repairability,
                        and customization. Product manufacturers should be regulated to reduce their environmental
                        footprint, E-waste generation, and waste generation. It is not within the power of the consumer
                        to change a systemic problem, and manufacturers should be forced into compliance with the
                        standardization of materials, connectors, and perhaps even material choice. As a designer, I
                        believe this will happen due to the environmental effects of mass overconsumption and ecological
                        neglect. Designers should prepare for this regulation by learning about sustainable materials,
                        modularity, and the circular economy.

                        User experience
                        Many users are not adequately considered. I come from a union family, where I was taught the
                        importance of healthy workplaces. During my internship at EDAG, I talked to many delivery
                        drivers and considered changing my thesis topic completely. I encountered knee and hip injuries,
                        negative stigmas surrounding delivery drivers, and exceeding work pressure. I was intrigued by
                        how design can influence the workspace mentally and physically and would like to explore these
                        topics further in my professional career.

                    <p> The Centre of Expertise for Challenge-Based Learning became a formative experience for me. In a group of four rookie entrepreneurs, we were challenged to push the boundaries of our projects and mindsets. When we started the course, we tried fixing engineering and design problems. By the end, we shifted from bicycles to hydroponics and landed on an augmented reality application for language learning, because we used value maps, empathy maps and business model canvasses. This approach and creative process changed our perception of innovation. Instead of trying to create a product with innovative technology, the value network lead to more grounded decision making.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Throughout the program, I significantly  my presentation skills and acquired the ability to assess whether a product possessed a viable market fit. Additionally, I delved into the exploration of value networks and discovered how designers can play a more active role in the overall market success of a product. The process was a valuable learning experience, as it taught us to adapt and iterate based on feedback, validation and market demands.&nbsp; </p>

                    <h2>USER EXPERIENCE THEORY AND PRACTICE</h2>
                    <p>After learning about the state-of-the-art of UX, we took part in a design challenge by PHILIPS to improve the user experience for hospital
                        patients
                        waiting for treatment. We focused on reducing discomfort and anxiety by creating a calming and
                        interactive waiting room environment. My responsibilities included conducting expert interviews,
                        ideation, and prototyping.
                        <br><br>
                        The challenge was to reduce anger in patients in the waiting room. In the United States, people
                        can walk
                        into the hospital waiting room. When one's situation is more severe, they can be treated faster,
                        while
                        others have to wait longer. This difference in waiting time can lead to patient frustration,
                        ranging
                        from annoyance to more serious consequences.
                        <br><br>

                        Our concept was that the patients required segmentation based on the severity of their medical
                        condition. The waiting room was segmented into four so that the less urgent color codes could
                        not see
                        the desk while the urgent patients could. This layout was paired with an application that indicates waiting times, but is also transparent when an emergency patient has to be treated priorly. The application is visualised as an aquarium.

                    <p>In the course 'Data Enabled Design,' I worked with four people to create MINEBIRD - a bird-shaped
                        device
                        that communicates air quality in an engaging and informative way. My role in the project
                        involved
                        ideation, CAD modeling, and rapid prototyping of various components.
                        We utilized sensors to gather air quality data which was sent to Datafoundry, which was then communicated to the user through
                        the
                        bird's movement and LED lights.
						
						The shape of a canarie was chosen as an emulation of the use of birds through mining tunnels throughout history. If the air quality drops below a treshhold, the bird's head starts lowering.
						The bird's electronics consisted of an ESP32 which was outfitted with an air-quality sensor, step motor and several LEDs.
                        The project allowed us to explore the intersection of data and design and create an innovative
                        solution

                        During the

In a group of four students we were assigned the topic of agoraphobia; the fear of wide-open spaces. I learned about art history, mood boards, expression, and visual communication. In later assignments, students were free to choose their own topics. I saw this as an oppertunity to mix my
                        interests in Blender 3D and adobe Photoshop to visualise a design manifesto for 'design on mars'. I implemented different fonts, aesthetics and self-made assets to communicate our vision on a future multi-cultural and technologically advanced mars colony.

                      worked on implementing vibrational feedforward for rear-facing passengers in automated vehicles. I developed a VR application in which the participants would be driven through the TU/e campus. This prototype was paired with a seat outfitted with four vibrotactile actuators, connected to an Arduino board. By synchronising the vibrations with the moments where the simulated vehicle would turn, corners could be anticipated. This reduced the VR motion sickness. During this project I learned about Unity 3D, programming, user studies and research methods. </p>

                    <p> During this course, we conducted constructive design research on haptic feedback in
                        automated
                        vehicle car seats. We aimed to explore how haptic feedback can enhance the user experience in

						We developed a test prototype, consisting of a seat cover with muplitple vibriting actuators. We used this research prototype in a stationary vehicle to research how different vibrational patterns would affect users.
                        I found that a lab approach would be far more suitable for future automated vehicle testing.
                        Since I was

                        In the course Interactive Materiality, we explored the relationship between materials and
                        interaction design, and how they can be combined to create novel and engaging user experiences.
                        As a group of students, we worked on the THOM project, which aimed to design new materiality
                        through the combination of interaction gestalt, materials, and actuators. We investigated the
                        role of haptic and tactile feedback in creating meaningful interactions and explored different
                        materials and actuation methods to achieve our design goals. Our project focused on the design
                        of an interactive surface that would respond to user inputs with a variety of visual and haptic
                        feedback, and we used our knowledge of material properties and interaction design to create a
                        unique and compelling user experience.
						Our final design consisted of a silicone - infused synthetic textile, with a rotating 3d-printed TPU structure, which was ment to express the caustics and movement of bodies of water. Although the research on interactive materiality was an interesting topic, this course also contributed to my concern for sustainabillity, since the mixing of materials and the implementation of electronics made me consider the environmental effects of such design theories.

                I approached the EDAG group to explore sustainability within the commercial vehicle market. By combining the expert knowledge and experience from EDAG Helmond, my experience from the research design development track, my practical skills, my passion for automotive design, and my TU/Ecomotive experience, I wish to end my academic career by combining my interests, knowledge, and enthusiasm into a final master project. <br> <br>

                In this project, I researched the context of commercial vehicles in urban zones regarding the electrification and circularity potential to maximise sustainability in a financially viable method. The car is designed to perform in a product service system and to optimise its lifespan in an economically viable way. This shift to PSS emphasises resource optimisation, reduced environmental impact, and improved economic performance. This is done by considering the product hierarchy and customisation service.
                <br> <br>

              I am grateful for the opportunity to collaborate with Wouter and Richard, whose expertise and insights were inspiring. Throughout the project, I found the circular economy concept exciting. Learning about it and reading about its principles was a valuable experience, and implementation was challenging. The project has taught me essential lessons about prioritisation, adaptability, and the power of collaboration. I look forward to applying the knowledge I gained to future endeavours and remain enthusiastic about the circular economy.

                different clients and industries. Working on shorter, more diverse projects will expose me to new
                challenges, technologies, and design trends, contributing to my professional growth and development.

                I will become a teacher for design sketching classes because I have an exceptional drive for the subject, and I want to share my knowledge and skills with others. Teaching design sketching will allow me to reach future designers and provide them with the necessary tools. I found learning from Martijn van der Wiel inspiring and enjoyed being a teacher's assistant. This position will also help me because teaching requires a deep understanding of the subject, pushing me to improve my design techniques and knowledge.
