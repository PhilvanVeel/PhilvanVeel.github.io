            <p class="lead" style="color: black;">I am an Industrial design master’s student, who is driven to work in
                the automotive industry
                as a designer. I have a broad range of experience in automotive design, product design, and furniture
                design. My experience and training in design sketching and 3D modeling allow me to iterate rapidly. My
                knowledge of storytelling, product manufacturing, user experience, and ergonomics results in an
                efficient
                design process and a concept proposal based on the user and stakeholder's requirements.</p>

                <p class="lead">Manufacturers should explore modularity since it can offer product flexibility,
                    repairability, and customization. Product manufacturers should be regulated to reduce their
                    environmental footprint, E-waste generation, and waste generation. It is not within the power of the
                    consumer to change a systemic problem, and manufacturers should be forced into compliance with the
                    standardization of materials, connectors, and perhaps even material choice. As a designer, I believe
                    this will happen due to the environmental effects of mass overconsumption and ecological neglect.
                    Designers should prepare for this regulation by learning about sustainable materials, modularity,
                    and the circular economy.

                    the importance of healthy workplaces. During my internship at EDAG, I talked to many delivery

                    negative stigmas surrounding delivery drivers, and exceeding work pressure. I was intrigued by how
                    design can influence the workspace mentally and physically and would like to explore these topics

                    <p>Personal growth is always my number one priority in design. During projects, I always learn a new
                        skills. During 1.1, I did an innovation space project requiring a more business-like mindset and
                        skillset. In my 1.2, I did not only do my first design research project but also made it in
                        Unity. I will make sure to develop new skills during 2.1.
                        <br> <br>

                        I always wanted to pursue a career in the automotive industry, which led me to lead the
                        TU/Ecomotive Design team. Because of that experience, I was hired for intern positions at EBUSCO
                        and EDAG BV. These valuable experiences provided insight into working in the automotive
                        industry. I have done extracurricular activities such as Unity certificates, following
                        automotive sketching courses, and working as a teacher assistant for the exploratory sketching
                        course. I have many topics that I would like to learn more about. However, spare time is limited
                        during a master's track, so I always tried to implement my curiosity into my projects. 
                        
                        <br> <br>
                        During this master's program, I realized that corporate positions might not suit my interests. After
                        graduation, my goal is to find a job in sketching education and join a design studio. The one
                        consistency in my prior PDPs besides the automotive interest is that I switch interests often,
                        and having my design studio would mean I can work on a diverse and conceptual project. My
                        long-term goal is to establish my design studio.
                        <br> <br>

                        In my work environment, I value dedication and honesty. Sharing a passion and cultivating a
                        healthy, dedicated, and personal atmosphere is more important than anything in a creative field
                        since input equals output.

                    <p>Whereas most of my PIV documents were tailored towards automotive, I keep my final iteration more
                        general since my future goal is to diversify my projects. Although my automotive interest will
                        not likely ever stop, I would like to explore new topics for my starting position.
                        Sustainability
                        Manufacturers should explore modularity since it can offer product flexibility, repairability,
                        and customization. Product manufacturers should be regulated to reduce their environmental
                        footprint, E-waste generation, and waste generation. It is not within the power of the consumer
                        to change a systemic problem, and manufacturers should be forced into compliance with the
                        standardization of materials, connectors, and perhaps even material choice. As a designer, I
                        believe this will happen due to the environmental effects of mass overconsumption and ecological
                        neglect. Designers should prepare for this regulation by learning about sustainable materials,

                    <p>
                        The Centre of Expertise for Challenge-Based Learning became a formative experience for me. In a
                        group of
                        four rookie entrepreneurs, we were challenged to push the boundaries of our projects and
                        mindsets. When
                        we started the course, we tried fixing engineering and design problems. By the end, we shifted
                        from
                        bicycles to hydroponics and landed on an augmented reality application for language learning.

                        assess whether a product possessed a viable market fit. Additionally, I delved into the
                        exploration of
                        value networks and discovered how designers can play a more active role in the overall market
                        success of
                        a product.
                        Nevertheless, the process was a valuable learning experience, as it taught us to adapt and
                        iterate based
                        on feedback and market demands.

                    <p>For this course, my group was challenged by PHILIPS to improve the user experience for hospital
                        patients
                        waiting for treatment. We focused on reducing discomfort and anxiety by creating a calming and
                        interactive waiting room environment. My responsibilities included conducting expert interviews,
                        ideation, and prototyping.
                        <br><br>
                        The challenge was to reduce anger in patients in the waiting room. In the United States, people
                        can walk
                        into the hospital waiting room. When one's situation is more severe, they can be treated faster,
                        while
                        others have to wait longer. This difference in waiting time can lead to patient frustration,
                        ranging
                        from annoyance to violence.
                        <br><br>

                        Our concept was that the patients required segmentation based on the severity of their medical
                        condition. The waiting room was segmented into four so that the less urgent color codes could
                        not see
                        the desk while the urgent patients could.

                I approached the EDAG group to explore sustainability within the commercial vehicle market. By combining
                the expert knowledge and experience from EDAG Helmond, my experience from the research design
                development track, my practical skills from my bachelor, my passion for automotive design, and my
                experience from being part of the TU/Ecomotive student team, I wish to end my academic career by
                combining my passion, knowledge, and enthusiasm into a final master project.
                <br> <br>

                In this project, we researched the context of commercial vehicles in urban zones regarding the
                electrification and circularity potential to maximize sustainability in a financially viable method.
                The vehicle is designed to perform in a product service system and maximize its lifespan in a
                financially viable method. This shift to PSS emphasizes resource optimization, reduced environmental
                impact, and improved economic performance. This is done by considering the product hierarchy, segment,
                and customization service.
                <br> <br>

                The topic of designing a versatile electric vehicle turned out to be more extensive than I initially
                anticipated. I encountered some challenges along the way and sometimes felt a bit stuck. Due to time
                constraints, I couldn’t evaluate the design as thoroughly as I had hoped.
                I am grateful for the opportunity to collaborate with Wouter and Richard, whose expertise and insights
                were truly inspiring. Their contributions helped shape the design in meaningful ways. Throughout the
                project, I found the circular economy concept particularly inspiring. Learning about it and reading
                about its principles was a valuable experience, even though I faced some difficulty in implementing
                those ideas.
                Overall, I'm proud of the progress in developing a vehicle concept that aligns with the needs and
                aspirations of our target users. The project has taught me essential lessons about prioritization,
                adaptability, and the power of collaboration. I look forward to applying the knowledge I gained to
                future endeavours and remain enthusiastic about the circular economy concept.

                I will create my own design studio as a part-time business, because I want to work on shorter and more
                diverse projects, and I believe that my hardskills, user centred process and innovation method can help
                me grow in this
                field. Starting my own business will allow me to choose projects that align with my interests and
                abilities. It will allow me to work on various design projects, including digital design, graphic
                design,
                and product design. I will be able to slowly build up my repetaire and tasks. This will enable me to
                improve my skills and expertise by constantly engaging with
                different clients and industries. Working on shorter, more diverse projects will expose me to new
                challenges, technologies, and design trends, contributing to my professional growth and development.

                I will become a teacher for design sketching classes because I have a passion for design and want to
                share my knowledge and skills with others. Teaching design sketching will allow me to inspire and
                empower future designers. Because I have a strong foundation in design sketching and enjoy helping
                others develop their sketching abilities, becoming a teacher will allow me to impact students' creative
                journeys. I found learning from Martijn van der Wiel inspiring and enjoyed being a teacher
                assistant. Besides, Teaching requires a deep understanding of the subject, pushing me to continuously
                improve with the latest design techniques and trends. It will also allow me to learn
                from my students' perspectives and approaches.
