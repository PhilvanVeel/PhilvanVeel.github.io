In a group of four students, we were challenged to use Artificial Inteligence combined with image processing to create a business proposal. Our group conceptualised an AI-powered web navigation tool to assist students in finding relevant information online. Using the methods from 'the lean startup' by Eric van Ries, we underwent an iterative process to create a business proposal. We had to validate assumptions, decide when to persist, persevere or perish. For me, this course was almost like a continuation of the Innovation Space project, but paired with more elaborate and comprehensive methods. The skills and lessons from Innovation Space became more a more structured procces with more clarity and scientific bases. It bridged the acedemic methods with the pragmatic validation.
