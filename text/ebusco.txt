<h3>EBUSCO</h3>
Within Ebusco, I wanted to perform user-centred design, for which I interviewed people on the street and in questionnaires. This led me to several smaller projects. I experimented using Gravity Sketch, a VR drawing tool. This led to a light-emitting ceiling and angled chairs to increase the presence of windows in the field of view. I used ANSYS simulation to create an optimised bus pole connection to decrease the blockage of the ceiling lights.

I used Unity 3D to improve the audit process. It currently is a labour-intensive process. I created a UI, which developed my competencies in creating real-time graphics. I implemented my knowledge from innovation space, M1.2, Design innovation strategies, principles of aesthetics and user experience, leading to multiple design proposals.
