Within Ebusco I wanted to perform user-centred design, for which I interview people on the street and in questionnaires. I ideated using design sketching based the user responses, but also expirimented using Gravity sketch, a VR drawing tool. This lead to a light-emitting ceiling and angled chairs to increase the presence of windows in the field of view. I used ANSYS simulation to create an optimised bus pole connection, to decrease the blockage of the ceiling lights.

I also decided to use Unity 3D to improve the audit process of Ebusco since I noticed that the current process was highly labour intensive. I completed unity certificates and created a web UI, along with design proposals to improve the atmosphere on the bus. I developed my compitencies in implementing rea-time graphics, working outside of the design brief on where I found that the company could be more efficient. I implemented my knowledge from innovation space, M1.2, Design innovation strategies, principles of aesthetics and user experience leading to multiple design proposals.
