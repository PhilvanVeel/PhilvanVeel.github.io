<h3>TU/ecomotive</h3>
As chief automotive designer, I was responsible for the exterior and interior design of a sustainable electric car developed by the TU/Ecomotive student team, which aimed to achieve CO2 neutrality. My tasks included developing the packaging, exterior and interior design, and collaborating with the other Chiefs. In the span of a year, my team of 3 design students developed the car from idea to production in one year.

As chief design, I was responsible for managing the design team, creating concept sketches and 3D concept models and being responsible for the quality of the interior and exterior of the car. The design of the car is just the physical manifestation of the challenges, successes, setbacks and growth we went through. What I am even more proud of is the amazing creative team we have formed together.
