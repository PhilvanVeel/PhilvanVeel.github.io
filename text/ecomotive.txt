Chief automotive designer responsible for the exterior and interior design of a sustainable electric car developed by the TU/Ecomotive student team, achieving CO2 neutrality. Developed the packaging, exterior, and interior design leading a team of 3 design students from concept to production in one year. As chief design I was responsible for managing the design team, creating concept sketches, 3D concept models and end responsible for the quality of the interior and exterior of the car. The design of the car is just the the physical manifestation of the challenges, successes, setbacks and growth we went through. What I am even more proud of is the positive, rewarding and creative team we have formed together.
