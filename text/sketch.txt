During the pandemic, I wanted to have a course in my comfort zone and improve my hard skills. During the course, I became driven to become a teacher assistant since this would allow learning about education and sketching and help finance my study.

During a guest lecture by Luciano Bove, I also established a connection and became his student. When I met Luciano Luciano Bove, I wanted to join his one-on-one lectures on automotive design sketching. Not only was it enjoyable and informative, but I also implemented his insights into my student team design. It made me more confident in my abilities, and I learned to work faster. Also, shading organic shapes opened new possibilities for expressing and exploring shapes. 

 I had the amazing opportunity to assist Martijn van der Wiel's classes for a year. Assisting his classes allowed me to improve my own design sketching abilities, while also learning how to teach others. Helping to teach others how to sketch has allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of the sketching process and how to effectively communicate ideas through sketches. I realised that the process of learning requires a more analytical approach, and that the mentality of students is one of the most contributing factors to skill-development.
