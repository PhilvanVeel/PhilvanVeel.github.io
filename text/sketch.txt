<h3>Sketching</h3>
I became driven to become a teacher assistant since this would allow learning about education and sketching and help finance my studies.
When I met Luciano Luciano Bove during a guest lecture, I wanted to join his one-on-one lectures on automotive sketching. I implemented his insights into my student team design, and my design sketching changed. It made me more confident in my abilities, and sketching more organic shapes opened new possibilities. 
I had the fantastic opportunity to assist Martijn van der Wiel's classes for two years. Assisting his classes taught me how to teach others and developed my understanding of design sketching and creativity. I gained an understanding of how to effectively communicate ideas through sketches rapidly. I realised that the learning process requires a more analytical approach and that the mentality of students is one of the most significant contributing factors to skill development. I shifted tools and focus and allowed my hands to do the thinking, which made the outcome more creative and surprising, even to myself.
