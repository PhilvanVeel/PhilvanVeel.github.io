In the course 'Data Enabled Design,' I worked with four people to create MINEBIRD - a bird-shaped device that communicates air quality in an engaging and informative way. My role in the project involved ideation, CAD modeling, and rapid prototyping of various components. We utilized sensors to gather air quality data which was sent to Datafoundry, which was then communicated to the user through the bird's movement and LED lights. The shape of a canarie was chosen as an emulation of the use of birds through mining tunnels throughout history. If the air quality drops below a treshhold, the bird's head starts lowering. The bird's electronics consisted of an ESP32 which was outfitted with an air-quality sensor, step motor and several LEDs. The project allowed us to explore the intersection of data and design and create an innovative solution that informs the user about awareness about their air quality.
