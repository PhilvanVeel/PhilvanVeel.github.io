<h3>COMPDEV</h3>
Throughout my projects and extracurricular activities, I have demonstrated a will to experiment with new creative processes, seek inspiration, implement user-centered design, find new ways to implement technologies, widen my network, and improve my application of the research and design development process. I have found my vision regarding technology, design and what role they should play in society.
