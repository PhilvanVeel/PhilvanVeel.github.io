In this project, I researched the context of commercial vehicles in urban zones regarding the electrification and circularity potential to maximise sustainability in a financially viable method. The car is designed to perform in a product service system and to optimise its lifespan in an economically viable way. This shift to PSS emphasises resource optimisation, reduced environmental impact, and improved economic performance. This is done by considering the product hierarchy and customisation service.
