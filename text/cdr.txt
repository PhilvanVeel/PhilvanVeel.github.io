During this course, we conducted constructive design research on haptic feedback in automated vehicle car seats. We aimed to explore how haptic feedback can enhance the user experience in automated vehicle car seats. We developed a test prototype, consisting of a seat cover with muplitple vibriting actuators. We used this research prototype in a stationary vehicle to research how different vibrational patterns would affect users. I found that a lab approach would be far more suitable for future automated vehicle testing. Since I was interested in continuing to work in this field, I decided to use virtual reality in my M2.1 project, leaning more toward quantitative data.
