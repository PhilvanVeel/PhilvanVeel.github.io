<h3>PRINCIPLES OF AESTHETICS</h3>
After an overview of aesthetic theory, students were challenged to create mood boards on several topics. In a group of four students, we were assigned the topic of agoraphobia, the fear of wide-open spaces. I learned about art history, mood boards, expression, and visual communication. In later assignments, students were free to choose their topics. I saw this as an opportunity to combine my Blender 3D and Adobe Photoshop interests to visualise a design manifesto for 'Design on Mars'. I implemented different fonts, aesthetics and self-made assets to communicate our vision of a future multicultural and technologically advanced Mars colony.
