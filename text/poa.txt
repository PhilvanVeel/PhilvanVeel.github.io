After an overview of aesthetic theory, students were challenged to create moodboards on several topics. In a group of four students we were assigned the topic of agoraphobia; the fear of wide-open spaces. I learned about art history, mood boards, expression, and visual communication. In later assignments, students were free to choose their own topics. I saw this as an oppertunity to mix my interests in Blender 3D and adobe Photoshop to visualise a design manifesto for 'design on mars'. I implemented different fonts, aesthetics and self-made assets to communicate our vision on a future multi-cultural and technologically advanced mars colony.
