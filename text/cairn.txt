<h2>CAIRN</h2>

Inspired by the metaphor of stacking pebbles, Cairn uses movements to convey posture information. This unique interaction aesthetic transforms the posture correction into an aesthetically pleasing and enjoyable experience.
Cairn combines interaction aesthetics with real-time feedback for a user-centric experience to provide posture feedback. The prototype, developed through electronics, laser-cutting and 3D printing, blends into users' workspaces. The design uses cast latex pressure sensor belts on an office chair and a feedback device on desks, making it easy to use
The prototype heightens posture awareness, motivates users to maintain their sitting posture, and positively impacts their perceived increase in upright sitting.
