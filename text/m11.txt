The Centre of Expertise for Challenge-Based Learning became a formative experience for me. In a group of four rookie entrepreneurs, we were challenged to push the boundaries of our projects and mindsets. When we started the course, we tried fixing engineering and design problems. By the end, we shifted from bicycles to hydroponics and landed on an augmented reality application for language learning, because we used value maps, empathy maps and business model canvasses. This approach and creative process changed our perception of innovation. Instead of trying to create a product with innovative technology, the value network lead to more grounded decision making. 

Throughout the program, I significantly my presentation skills and acquired the ability to assess whether a product possessed a viable market fit. Additionally, I delved into the exploration of value networks and discovered how designers can play a more active role in the overall market success of a product. The process was a valuable learning experience, as it taught us to adapt and iterate based on feedback, validation and market demands.
