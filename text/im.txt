<h3>INTERACTIVE MATERIALITY</h3>
In Interactive Materiality, we explored the relationship between materials and interaction design and how they can be combined to create new and engaging user experiences. As a group of 4 students, we worked on the THOM project to design new materiality by combining interaction gestalt, materials, and actuators. We investigated the role of haptic and tactile feedback in creating meaningful interactions and explored different materials and actuation methods to achieve our design goals. Our final design consisted of a silicone-infused synthetic textile with a rotating 3D-printed TPU structure, which was meant to express the caustics and movement of bodies of water. Although the research on interactive materiality was an exciting topic, this course also contributed to my concern for sustainability since mixing materials and implementing electronics made me consider the environmental effects of such design theories.
