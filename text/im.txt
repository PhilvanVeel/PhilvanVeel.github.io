In the course Interactive Materiality, we explored the relationship between materials and interaction design, and how they can be combined to create novel and engaging user experiences. As a group of students, we worked on the THOM project, which aimed to design new materiality through the combination of interaction gestalt, materials, and actuators. We investigated the role of haptic and tactile feedback in creating meaningful interactions and explored different materials and actuation methods to achieve our design goals. Our project focused on the design of an interactive surface that would respond to user inputs with a variety of visual and haptic feedback, and we used our knowledge of material properties and interaction design to create a unique and compelling user experience. Our final design consisted of a silicone - infused synthetic textile, with a rotating 3d-printed TPU structure, which was ment to express the caustics and movement of bodies of water. Although the research on interactive materiality was an interesting topic, this course also contributed to my concern for sustainabillity, since the mixing of materials and the implementation of electronics made me consider the environmental effects of such design theories.
