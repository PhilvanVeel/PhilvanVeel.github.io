Master project 2.1: vibrational feedforward for rear-facing passengers During my Master project 2.1, I worked on implementing vibrational feedforward for rear-facing passengers in automated vehicles. I developed a VR application in which the participants would be driven through the TU/e campus. This prototype was paired with a seat outfitted with four vibrotactile actuators, connected to an Arduino board. By synchronising the vibrations with the moments where the simulated vehicle would turn, corners could be anticipated. This reduced the VR motion sickness. During this project I learned about Unity 3D, programming, user studies and research methods.
