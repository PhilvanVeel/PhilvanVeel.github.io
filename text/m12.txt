<h3>M2.1: VIBRATIONAL FEEDFORWARD FOR REAR-FACING PASSENGERS</h3>
 During my Master project 2.1, I worked on implementing vibrational feedforward for rear-facing passengers in automated vehicles. I developed a VR application to drive the participants through the TU/e campus virtually. This prototype was paired with a seat mat outfitted with four vibrotactile actuators connected to an Arduino board. By synchronising the vibrations with the moments where the simulated vehicle would turn, corners could be anticipated. This reduced the VR motion sickness compared to experiencing the route without feedback. I learned about Unity 3D, programming, user studies and research methods during this project.
